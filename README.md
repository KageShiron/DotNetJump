# ![logo](public/static/img/logo.svg) DotNetJump

**DotNetJump** is a Google Chrome and Firefox extension for .NET developers.

## Features
* Search multiple documents for .NET at once.
* Search the selected word.
* Automatically input a name in the supported sites. (For example, you can easily jump to Docs while browsing MSDN. )

## Supported documents
* [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/)
* [Reference Source](https://referencesource.microsoft.com/)
* [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/)

Each of the websites has different search algorithms. I think that there're no perfect way to find correct pages. Especially, it is difficult to search generics types and these members.
